# NumberArray Project
---

## **Overview**
This repository contains a complete implementation of the ArrayOfNumbers class and a Windows Forms application. It is provided as part of the UG409765 - Software Construction module for BSc Computing students at the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI).

The project is intended to aid students who could not complete Exercise 3 and will be used to teach testing concepts such as unit testing with NUnit. It should not be seen as a replacement for completing the exercise independently, but as a supplementary resource.

---

## **Usage**
The ArrayOfNumbers project serves as:
- A reference implementation for students to learn testing concepts.
- A practical foundation for practicing unit testing and exploring good programming practices.
- A resource for understanding how to integrate business logic with a Windows Forms GUI.
